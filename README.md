- ⚡ Fun fact: ...Hi  I have Parkinson's.  I was looking around to try to find something to make a little money.  Not much just some.  First I got scammed in a mining thing.
- Then I tried Cornix and then shit coins.  With the shit coins came the Unibot and the Unibot lead me to Copy trading that led me to know that most of the trading in
- shit coins is done by bots.  That led me here.  So I am going to build a bot.  Sorry if I screw up a little while I'm here, I'll try not to. If you lend a hand that would be great.  Thanks  Bill
